# Contributing
This repo gives you a guideline to contribute to the distro itself and its components in a way that everyone understand what you do.

## Commit Convention
The commit messages must begin with a **tag** which describes what the commit does.
There are currently 4 useful tags that we use to name commits:
- **feat:** Your commit adds a new feature.
- **fix:** Your commit fixes a bug or does some refacto.
- **docs:** Your commit creates a new documentation or edits an existing one.
- **project:** Something not often needed for you, since it should be only used by the project owner to initialize the repo or to do something really important.

Your commit **must begin with one of these tags and your description should begin with a lowercase letter** in order to be accepted by the team.
Indeed, we can't accept commits which are named incorrectly because the community can grow up and we should be able to track the flow of code easily. But don't be afraid, we're not going to eat you ! üòÅ
